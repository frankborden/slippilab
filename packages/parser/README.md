# Parser

A basic browser-friendly .slp file parser.

The official [@slippi/slippi-js](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-js#readme) parser is maintained by the [Slippi](https://slippi.gg) team, is more feature rich, and is always up to date. However, it relies on Node's Buffer structs and has other features that are not browser-compatible. It is possible to use the official parser in the browser with the right polyfills and build tooling, but doing so can add a lot complexity to some web apps.

Fields up to spec version `3.9.0.0` are currently supported. The .slp file specification can be found [here](https://github.com/project-slippi/slippi-wiki/blob/master/SPEC.md).

If a field is not present, likely because the format was expanded after the replay was created, it is left `undefined` instead of throwing an error. This is intentionally not reflected in the types to make them more convenient to work with, but will be occasionally inaccurate. If these missing data cases are important to you, consider checking the Game.formatVersion string for the replay or wrapping the parser types in [Partial\<T>](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype) or [DeepPartial\<T>](https://github.com/krzkaczor/ts-essentials#deep-wrapper-types).

## Install

### Yarn

```
yarn add @slippilab/parser
```

### npm

```
npm install @slippilab/parser
```

### URL import from a CDN

```
import { parseReplay } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@slippilab/parser';
```

## Example

```
<html>
  <script type="module">
    import { parseReplay } from 'https://cdn.skypack.dev/@slippilab/parser';
    const input = document.querySelector('#replayInput');
    input.onchange = async () =>
      console.log(parseReplay(await input.files[0].arrayBuffer()));
  </script>
  <input id="replayInput" type="file"/>
</html>
```

## Future work ideas

1. Finish exposing various fields from the file. There are a lot of less important fields are still left as TODOs.
